# Password Pistol

A password brute-force gun using an Arduino Leonardo (ATMega32u4) dev board. 

I included the following 007 themed letter for the recipient: 

> Were you expecting an exploding pen? 
> 
> Well here is your Password Pistol - a one of a kind password guessing gun, designed to unlock unattended workstations you may happen across. 
> 
> It's loaded with a uniquely sourced list of passwords, tailored to your specific needs.
> 
> Now pay attention John, it's simple. Plug it into your target's computer and fire off passwords by pressing the red button at the top of the pistol.
> 
> Need I remind you John, that you have a license to hack, not to commit cyber crimes.
> 
> - Q
